## Getting involved

There are numerous ways to be involved in this project.

## Are you a person with diabetes with a research question? Work with the data science team. 

Stay tuned - you can work with the data science team on a research question that you have that can be answered by already-collected diabetes data.

## Are you a research wanting to work with a patient community?

We can help, by sharing what we've learned about patient innovators and researchers. Please contact us via team@openingpathways.org
