There are numerous ways to be involved in this project.

### Are you a person with diabetes with a research question? Work with the data science team. 

Stay tuned - you can work with the data science team on a research question that you have that can be answered by already-collected diabetes data.

### Are you a patient from another patient community, interested in working with our open source materials?

One goal of the project is to create some open source materials that will help patients in other communities scale their work, whether it's research, a data tool, or some other innovation. Stay tuned to hear more about those materials as they become available.
